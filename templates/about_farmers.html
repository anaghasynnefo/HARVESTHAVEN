        <h4>Meet Sijo From Kerala!</h4>
        <p>â€œI am a South Indian, born and raised in UAE. My dad comes from a family of farmers and with little knowledge he started planting some plants like Mint, Moringa, Curry leaf, Aloe Vera, Tomato, Tapioca, Melon, Indian Spinach, Sweet potato by the side of our house. Due to the heat and not enough knowledge, the harvest used to be very low but we enjoyed working side by side. Those are the fondest memories I have with my father. We are well known in our neighbourhood because we share our beans, Moringa and tapioca with everyone who simply glances at our garden.</p>
